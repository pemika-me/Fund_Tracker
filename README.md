# FUND TRACKER
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/wsC7_PsZc78
#### Description:
>A web-based application using Python, SQL, HTML and CSS for tracking the invested funds which are related to tax benefit in Thailand. However, the investor can also use this website to keep record of all investment including other type of fund in one place. The investor will be able to get a big picture how much money they have invested so far, as well as the proportion of each type of fund visualized by a donut chart. This website supports both full desktop and mobile screens by implementing CSS grid and Bootstrap v5.3


#### Background:

>There are three types of mutual fund in Thailand which can be used for tax deduction

    1. RMF (Retirement Mutual Fund)
        - Holding period        : Not less than 5 calendar years from the date of purchase
        - Redemption period     : When the investor is 55 years of age
        - Continuous investment : Required, at least once every other year
        - Eligible period       : Ongoing

    2. SSF (Super Savings Fund)
        - Holding period        : Not less than 10 calendar years from the date of purchase
        - Redemption period     : At the end of ending period
        - Continuous investment : Not required
        - Eligible period       : Investment from the year 2020 â€“ 2024

    3. LTF (Long Term Equity Fund)
        - Holding period        : Not less than 7 calendar years from the date of purchase
        - Redemption period     : At the end of ending period
        - Continuous investment : Not required
        - Eligible period       : Investment before January 1, 2020

> Each broker (or asset management company) is providing service on their own platform. In case that the investor invests in multiple mutual funds from different broker, it is not convenient to keep checking all different platforms throughout the holding period which is quite long. Fund Tracker web-application is initiated to help facilitate Thai investor to keep track of their all-own funds as one page summary. This is especially beneficial for RMF type which required the investor to continuously invest to maintain the tax deduction benefit until retirement. (visit https://www.uobam.co.th/en/tax-benefit/rmf for more detail)


### **++++ Notice**: This project was developed with misconception of RMF rebuying.  ++++
##### **I found out while writing this document that the investor does not need to continue buying the same fund. Buying different fund on the other year does not against investment condition for tax benefit as long as it's RMF type. But this web application was developed on the understanding that the same RMF fund needs to be continuously rebought until the investor becomes 55 years old and has held that fund for at least 5 calendar years before redemption to not against the condition for tax benefit. **

#### Features Overview and Design Explanation:
> Refer to my understanding (which is misconception for `RMF` type declared at the top of this document), the design is based on the inspiration to see the big picture of all funds an investor has held so far. Also aiming to remind the user to keep their investment to not against the tac benefit condition. That's why the `Home` page was designed in this way.

>
> In order to know which fund, how much, and when they have invested - the user needs to add information by themself as it is confidential data. `Add Fund` form was developed for this purpose.
>
> For `Introduction` page, the purpose here is used for overview the concept of all type of funds for tax benefit for a beginner. Also embed links for more detail and examples.
>
> `History` page is where the user can come to manage their added transactions. As the `Home` page is showing the aggregated data for each fund, it is not reasonable to make any change there.
> `Profile` page for this phase of development is for deleting account request. In the further development, email and birthdate should be able to edit as well. Please read _Room of Improvement_ topic below for more detail.


#### Room of Improvement:

> - Grey out multiple funds and put them at the bottom at once on the home page by using checkbox and send a command by confirmation button

>
> - Notification subscription - to get an email notification when the end-year and/or rebuy-year comes for subscribed item. Planned to include toggle button beside the checkbox for grey-out option above.
>
> - Forgot password option - to get a password reset link sent to user registered email via login page
> - Ability to update an email to support forgot password option and/or email notification in the future
> - Integrate with [Thai Fund Factsheet API](https://api-portal.sec.or.th/api-details#api=5a28f6df2b3a6d1788d2025c&operation=03-%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%99) for real-time fund name suggestion while typing on the `/add-fund` page.
